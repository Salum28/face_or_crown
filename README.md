# Face or Crown App

The following project was made in a Flutter course i made, and the main goals of this app were:

* Learn how to send data to another screen;
* Pratice navigation between screens;

Also, one of the app's goals was to pratice layout creation and customization.
## How the App Works

When you inicialize the app, you will see a button to begin the game, when you click the button, a random number is generated to determine wich side of the coin you will see in the next screen, if it is 0, you will see Face, if it is 1, you will see Crown.
